===============

This replaces the method that Rails uses to generate the
FormAuthenticityToken. It's goal is to prevent the intermittent
InvalidAuthToken errors (which occur mainly on IE). They are caused
because Rails uses base64 to sanitize the random bytes generated and
base64 consists of things like '/', '=', '+', etc.

However, the ActiveSupport::SecureRandom module (provided by Rails)
also offers a method wich will give the random bytes as hex.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_(railway_signalling)#Token_only for the naming


Example
=======

There is no example, just install the plugin and it works
